# CPT205-assignment1
This program is developed based on the Freeglut library, with the aim of creating a two-dimensional electronic greeting card for inviting participants to the 2024 XJTLU graduation ceremony. The objective is to faithfully replicate the school's official invitation using a selection of representative design elements based on the school's promotional materials. The invitation card features the school's classic purple gradient as the background color, and includes silhouettes of the SIP campus central building, the iconic structures of the University of Liverpool, and the school's emblem as its primary elements. Figure 1 illustrates the sources of these 
iconic elements in the greeting card and their transformation within the program
